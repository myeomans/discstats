#point diff = (400 / x)
#where opp_rate is the rating of the opponent,
#and x is a factor that depends upon the score.
#(Note: we subtact the amount of (400/x) in the case of a loss.)
#x = 400/PD
#The formula for x is:
#  x = (2.5*(losing score/winning score)^2)

#losing score/winning score =
#  RRI <- function (x) sqrt(160/x)
